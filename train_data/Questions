Questions for TA:

-which sensor does the last sensor represent
-how to know which sensor is which?
-why is the last line only 20 datapoints long?

-Maybe we should just train a neural network on the default driver.
-or hard code a proper driver and train the neural network on this.
-make a very good autorecover
-how to make sure our neural network doesn't crash. (heuristics)
-why is our neural steering so bad.
-so we have to gather data
-let the neural network train on getting out of messy situations.
-can we train the neural network on getting out of a problem.
-train NN on being outside of the track.
-ask for good auto recover tips.
